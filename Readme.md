## 🚧 Project Goals & Future Features (To-Do)

This project is a work in progress. The current version establishes the front-end design (HTML/CSS). The next steps involve bringing the site to life with JavaScript.

Here is the planned roadmap:

* **[ ] Dynamic Cart:** Implement "Add to Cart" functionality using JavaScript and `localStorage` to store items.
* **[ ] Custom Gift Builder:** Build out the interactive "Customize Your Gift" page, allowing users to select multiple items to create a personalized gift box.
* **[ ] Dynamic Product Rendering:** Refactor the hard-coded HTML items into a `products.json` file and use JavaScript to fetch and display them on the page.
* **[ ] Client-Side Search:** Add a search bar to filter products in real-time.
* **[ ] Item Modals:** Create pop-up "modals" for each item to show more details and a description.
